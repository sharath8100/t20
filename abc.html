      The Indian Premier League Governing Council (IPL GC) met today via video-conference to decide on the issues concerning the IPL 2020 edition. Taking note of the prevailing COVID-19 situation in India, the IPL GC decided to stage the tournament in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the matches will be played in Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi subject to necessary clearances from the Government of India.

IPL 2020 will be played from 19th September and the final will be played on 10th November 2020. The 53-day tournament will witness 10-afternoon matches starting at 15:30 IST while the evening matches will start at 19:30 IST.

The Governing Council also discussed the comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which will be finalised and published in due course, including the agencies to execute and deliver a bio-secure environment for safe and successful conduct of IPL 2020 Season.

The Governing Council also reviewed the Player Regulations for replacement player for 2020 season.

Women’s T20 Challenge will also take place in the UAE and will comprise three teams with four matches to be played during the IPL Playoff week.

<h2>IPL 2020 Teams:</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>1. Royal challengers of banglore</h2><br>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/09/1599360914_kohli.jpg" alt="RCB">
<div> <h4>
 <strong>Squad:</strong> Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Devdutt Padikkal, Gurkeerat Mann Singh, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Navdeep Saini, Parthiv Patel, Pawan Negi, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Aaron Finch, Chris Morris, Josh Philippe, Pavan Deshpande, Dale Steyn, Shahbaz Ahamad, Isuru Udana, Adam Zampa
 <br>
<br>



<strong>Strengths:</strong>

It goes without saying that batting is their stronger suit. With the presence of Kohli, de Villiers, and a few Indian youngsters, RCB would bank heavily on these players to deliver once again. The addition of Aaron Finch should only bolster their chances of succeeding at the top.
They would also be pinning hopes on hard-hitting all-rounders, lower down the order. Moeen Ali had a brilliant run with the bat last season, while Shivam Dube would be itching to get some big innings under his belt. If Chris Morris is given a chance, he could be expected to do well in this role as well.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>

RCB just doesn't seem to get their bowling combination right. Year after year they seem to be repeating the same mistake of not having quality bowlers in their ranks. One would argue the presence of Dale Steyn, but a lot would depend on his fitness. Talking of Umesh Yadav, he can be brilliant on his day, but could be expensive too.

Yuzvendra Chahal would be hoping for some support from Adam Zampa in the spin department, if at all he gets a chance to play. Moeen Ali, these days, hardly looks like a spinner who could be relied upon. That's not all, the middle-order looks fragile too. After Kohli, Finch and ABD, there isn't anyone who can offer consistency. If RCB loses early wickets, they could be looking down the barrel. They would need their middle-order to function smoothly, if they want to go far in the tournament.

<h2>2.Mumbai indians</h2>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/03/09/Pictures/final-of-ipl-t20-2019-csk-vs_7060b2ae-61da-11ea-926b-bd7a11f61927.jpg" alt="mumbai indians" >
<div><h4><strong>squad :</strong>Rohit Sharma, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Anmolpreet Singh, Chris Lynn , Saurabh Tiwary, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga, Mitchell McClenaghan, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Mohsin Khan, Prince Balwant Rai Singh, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Anukul Roy, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Ishan Kishan, Quinton de Kock, Aditya Tare<br>
<br>  <strong>Strength:</strong> The batting mix composing of Rohit Sharma, Chris Lynn, Quinton de Kock, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, and Saurabh Tiwary makes the Mumbai Indians batting lineup very solid with plenty of opening and middle-order options play with. They have abundance in the all-rounders' department with Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, and Sherfane Rutherford as alternatives.

Apart from that, the fast-bowling department was already stable with Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga, Mitchell McClenaghan, and the addition of Trent Boult and Nathan Coulter-Nile has provided the depth. Having a strong Indian core is what makes the MI squad secure and dangerous.<br>

<br><strong>Weakness :</strong> Mumbai Indians seemed to have an excess of seam-bowling options that their spin-bowling looks bleak. Rahul Chahar is the lone option that conveys the impression of a wicket-taker while Krunal Pandya and Jayant Yadav are more likely to play the role of supporting bowlers. Though Wankhede assists the seamers, away games can hurt the 4-time champs having a shortage of spinners.<br>

<h2>3.Chennai super kings</h2>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRkljoZsiGew4g8Xjl3ikh2l7iJS2rKuAiTYQ&usqp=CAU" alt="csk" >
<div><h4><strong>squad : </strong>Narayan Jagadeesan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, KM Asif, Ravindra Jadeja, M Vijay, MS Dhoni, Josh Hazlewood, Kedar Jadhav, Harbhajan Singh, Karn Sharma, Piyush Chawla, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Imran Tahir, Deepak Chahar, Faf du Plessis, Shardul Thakur, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, Lungi Ngidi, Sam Curran, Monu Kumar, Shane Watson, Sai Kishore
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Strength :</strong>Strength: Chennai Super Kings were mostly settled even before the auctions began. They already have a quality batting lineup which has turned out well for them in the past. Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, skipper MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, and Murali Vijay make a strong batting group together with decent overseas as well as Indian options. Having experienced Indian batters in ample quantity is one of their major strengths going into the tournament.

Another fact that makes their case stronger is an abundance of quality spinners. They have a luxury of right-arm, left-arm finger spinners, and leg-spinners to choose from spread across both the Indian and overseas categories. Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Piyush Chawla, and Karn Sharma make a long list of bowlers that can utilize the Chepauk track to the fullest.

In addition to that, the 3-time champions have Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Mitchell Santner and Sam Curran as all-rounders to give depth in both the aspects of the game.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Weakness : </strong> Fast bowling is where CSK lacks depth, an aspect which can cost them games when they travel away. Deepak Chahar and Lungi Ngidi are the only options that can consistently lead them throughout the tournament, both with the new ball and at the death. The other options like Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, and Josh Hazlewood might not be the perfect choices while their go-to bowler over the years, Dwayne Bravo, has lost his sharpness in recent times.

<h2>4.Kolkata knight riders</h2>
 <br>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://images.thequint.com/thequint/2019-05/adb598cb-c818-4b82-b079-81483e3113f9/KKR.jpg" alt="kkr">
<div><h4><strong>squad : </strong>Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik, Harry Gurney, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Nitish Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Rinku Singh, Sandeep Warrier, Shivam Mavi, Shubman Gill, Siddhesh Lad, Sunil Narine, Pat Cummins, Eoin Morgan, Varun Chakravarthy, Tom Banton, Rahul Tripathi, Chris Green, M Siddharth, Praveen Tambe, Nikhil Naik
<br>
<br>
<strong>strength : </strong>Kolkata Knight Riders have plenty of overseas options in every category, which is batting, bowling, and all-rounder. While Englishmen Tom Banton and Eoin Morgan reinforce their batting, historic signing Pat Cummins, Lockie Ferguson, and Harry Gurney add to their fast-bowling arsenal. The all-rounders Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, and Chris Green give them plenty of options to play with.

The KKR middle-order looks solid after their past struggles with the addition of English skipper to the mix.

Their spin department is solid as well with the pair of Narine and Kuldeep in the lineup, and Chris Green as a backup.
<br>

<strong>Weakness : </strong> There is a dearth of quality Indian fast bowlers and overdependence on overseas players might make their options rigid, with Russell, Narine, Morgan, and Cummins expected to feature regularly in the XI.

In addition to that, they lack experienced Indian batsmen with only skipper Dinesh Karthik as a reliable option as Shubman Gill is still a rookie and Nitish Rana has been highly consistent.

<h2>5.Delhi capitals </h2>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQvfdHGB_RLdOstmfak4_l9KCjQOiE5xGuE6w&usqp=CAU" alt="dd">
<br>
<div> <h4><strong>squad : </strong>Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Jason Roy, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada, Keemo Paul, Mohit Sharma, Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, R Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, Anrich Nortje, Rishabh Pant, Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande<br>
<br>
<strong>strength : </strong> The Delhi-based franchise has managed to put up a strong squad for the forthcoming edition of IPL. Their batting looks strong with the presence of Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, Shimron Hetmyer, Alex Carey and Jason Roy as they have plenty of quality backup options.
The pace department consists of plenty of overseas options in Kagiso Rabada, Keemo Paul, Chris Woakes, Ishant Sharma, and Mohit Sharma.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Weakness:</strong> With Ishant Sharma's lack of skills at the death, Delhi Capitals overly rely on overseas seamers to bowl the pressure overs and that might hurt them in the time to come. With only 4 slots available for foreign players, at least two of them have to be taken by the seamers. Remaining slots might get filled by Hetmyer and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis to give them the balance, which makes it difficult for them to pick the talented Sandeep Lamichhane regularly.
Lack of a quality Indian all-rounder and a fast bowler who can bowl crucial overs might sting the balance of their team.

<h2>6.Kings X| punjab</h2>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2016/4/16/1_16a082ab4cf.1713896_3694287359_16a082ab4cf_large.jpg" alt="punjab">
<br>
<div><h4>
<strong>squad : </strong>Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, Karun Nair, Sarfaraz Khan, Mandeep Singh, Sheldon Cottrell, Ishan Porel, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohammed Shami, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Arshdeep Singh, Hardus Viljoen, M Ashwin, J Suchith, Harpreet Brar, Darshan Nalkande, Glenn Maxwell, James Neesham, Chris Jordan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Deepak Hooda, Tajinder Singh Dhillon, KL Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, Prabhsimran Singh.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Strength : </strong>The biggest strength for Kings XI Punjab is its power-packed batting lineup. Skipper KL Rahul, Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, Glenn Maxwell, Nicholas Pooran, Karun Nair, Mandeep Singh, and Sarfaraz Khan give them plenty of Indian and overseas options to play with.

On top of that, they have managed to get hold of all-round options that increase their batting depth and at the same time, can come-in to bowl a few overs. Maxwell, James Neesham, K. Gowtham, and Deepak Hooda make it to their all-rounders' list.
<br >
<br>
<strong>Weakness : </strong> What KXIP lacks is the class of spin-bowlers in their squad. They have Krishnappa Gowtham, Jagdeesha Suchith, Murugan Ashwin, and rookie Ravi Bishnoi to play with while playing foreign player Mujeeb Ur Rahman consistently might be difficult for them.

In addition to that, they only have Mohammed Shami as a bankable Indian seam-bowler and they might have to rely on Chris Jordan and Sheldon Cottrell to perform the job for them.

<h2>7.Rajasthan royals</h2><br>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcT3DhDd5u6-FtGI5VpKqOuJoZ2XCxq6NKDAog&usqp=CAU" alt="rr">
<br>
<div>
  <h4>
    <strong>Squad : </strong>Mahipal Lomror, Manan Vohra, Riyan Parag, Steve Smith, Robin Uthappa, David Miller, Ankit Rajpoot, Mayank Markande, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Varun Aaron, Jaydev Unadkat, Kartik Tyagi, Akash Singh, Oshane Thomas, Andrew Tye, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tewatia, Shashank Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Anirudha Joshi, Tom Curran, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson, Anuj Rawat<br>
    <br>
    <strong>strength : </strong>Rajasthan Royals have strengthened their core with the addition of Indian players like Robin Uthappa and a couple of good trades in Mayank Markande and Ankit Rajpoot. The retained options include Sanju Samson, Shreyas Gopal, Manan Vohra, and the re-signing of Jaydev Unadkat has lightened their pockets.

When it comes to overseas groups, RR has one of the strongest ones with each of them being a match-winner in one way or the other. Players like Jos Buttler, Steve Smith, Ben Stokes, and Jofra Archer can not only win matches but tournaments if they have a good season.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Weakness :</strong>Rajasthan Royals depends on their foreign players in every aspect of the game, be it batting, bowling, or all-rounder options. This is the reason why game-changers like David Miller and Andrew Tye might find themselves on the sidelines for the entire season. Though they make up a decent playing XI, they lack established Indian players on the bench who can take control of the game in case of injury.

Furthermore, they don't have versatility in their spin department, with most of them being wrist spinners.

<h2>8.Sunrisers of hyderabad</h2>
<br>
<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSQV35O2cdtUWutZHAVM9BR9wjmomPObpyi3A&usqp=CAU" alt="srh">
<div>
  <h4><strong>Squad : </strong>Kane Williamson, David Warner, Manish Pandey, Virat Singh, Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed, Sandeep Sharma, Siddharth Kaul, Billy Stanlake, T Natarajan, Abhishek Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Mitchell Marsh, Fabian Allen, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Sanjay Yadav, Jonny Bairstow, Wriddhiman Saha, Shreevats Goswami, Bavanaka Sandeep, Basil Thampi
  <br>
<br>
<strong>Strength:</strong> The former IPL champions have one of the most devastating opening pairs with a reputation of destroying the bowling lineups in international cricket. Their middle-order is supported by skipper Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Vijay Shankar and youngsters like Virat Singh and Priyam Garg.

Sunrisers Hyderabad has an exciting set of Indian bowlers in Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Siddharth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma, and Khaleel Ahmed. The Afghanistan duo of Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi makes their spin-attack more than decent.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Weakness : </strong> SRH's overseas slots looked occupied already with obvious choices in Jonny Bairstow, David Warner, skipper Kane Williamson, and leggie Rashid Khan. These names make them reluctant to make any changes except for an injury which might hurt them as the tournament progresses. It has made it difficult for them to slot in Australian quick Billy Stanlake even when the Indian bunch performs ordinarily.

Furthermore, they lack a quality Indian spin option to partner Rashid Khan with Shahbaz Nadeem as the best they can come up with.<br>
